# ReactAR

The project has been realised as part of the module 'Mobile Computing' by lecturer Michael Schellenbach. ReactAR offers information about planets, moons and dwarfplanets of 
our solar system. In addition it offers the option to look at some celestial bodies in augmented reality. 

The following guidelines & demands had to be fullfilled:
*  Total effort: 50-60 hours
*  Framework: React Native
*  Additional Feature: Augmented Reality, Machine Learning or GPS etc.
*  Additional Requirements: Usage of a database (MongoDB) and a webservice (NodeJS) to supply data to the application
*  Releasing the project at gitlab / github
*  Documentation of the project in gitlab / github

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Apple's iOS ARKit is only supported by Apple devices with A9 or later processors on iOS 11. Make sure you have at least an iPhone SE or 6s to run the application on 
your hardware. Android devices are not supported due to not implemented AR-bindings.

To preview the Augmented Reality, it's neccessary to run/build the application on the device by using XCode 9 or later. It's not possible to use the ARKit 
within the iOS Simulator.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
