# ReactAR

The project has been realised as part of the module 'Mobile Computing' by lecturer Michael Schellenbach. ReactAR offers information about planets, moons and dwarfplanets of 
our solar system. In addition it offers the option to look at some celestial bodies in augmented reality. 

The following guidelines & demands had to be fullfilled:
*  Total effort: 50-60 hours
*  Framework: React Native
*  Additional Feature: Augmented Reality, Machine Learning or GPS etc.
*  Additional Requirements: Usage of a database (MongoDB) and a webservice (NodeJS) to supply data to the application
*  Releasing the project at gitlab / github
*  Documentation of the project in gitlab / github

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
